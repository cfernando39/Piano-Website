				<h2>About Me</h2>
				
			
				<p>Music has always been a part of my life. Many of my family members are also involved with music either with singing, or playing an instrument. I started taking piano lessons when I was seven years old, and continued taking them for 12 years. I studied at a variety of music schools including Arcadia Academy of Music, Merriam School of Music, as well as with private piano instructors. </p>

				<p>After completing several RCM piano exams and having over 12 years of playing experience, I felt confident enough to start teaching piano. I have now been teaching piano privately for 5 years.<span data-toggle-target=".full-text" data-toggle-text="Hide the full text..."class="toggle-btn read-more">Read the full text...</span></p>

				<div class="full-text">
				<p><p>Although I started teaching piano in-person, I have been able to adapt and continuing teaching piano online through Zoom and a platform called LearnCube. I will continue teaching online until it is safe to move back to in-person classes.</p>

				<p>In addition to playing the piano, I also play the alto saxophone, guitar and sing. I started learning the alto saxophone once I was accepted into the Regional Arts Program at St. Elizabeth Catholic High School. I enjoyed it so much that I continued playing the saxophone during my studies at the University of Toronto within the Music Education Program. The alto saxophone was my main instrument where I studied with Chelsea Shanoff and Wallace Halladay. </p>

				<p>I graduated with a Bachelors of Music in 2019 and began Teachers College in the Fall of 2020 at OISE (Ontario Institute for Studies in Education). I hope to complete my Masters degree in 2022 and be a high school music teacher.</p>

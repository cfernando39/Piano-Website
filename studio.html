		<h2>About My Studio</h2>

			<p>Here at Chiara Fernando's Piano Studio, I welcome all who wish to learn how to play the piano regardless of age or experience. Having my piano studio at my home, presents a safe environment for students to learn and explore. </p>

			<p>I began my piano studio in 2016 and have had a variety of students ranging in age and abilities. Ensuring a well rounded background in music, I make sure to teach students about:
	 			<ul>
	 				<li>Music Theory</li>
	 				<li>Sight Reading</li>
	 				<li>Ear Training</li>
	 				<li>Technique</li>
	 				<li>Repertoire</li>
	 				<li>Musicianship</li>
	 				<li>Composition</li>
	 			</ul>

			</p> 

			<div class="full-text">
			<p>I use a variety of different resources in my lessons depending on the needs of each student. I have used the Piano Adventure books to help students grasp the concept of notes, the staff, and encouraging a healthy posture and technique. If students are interested in taking piano exams, I then switch them to the Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) books. I have had two students successful pass their RCM exam with First Class Honors. </p> </div>

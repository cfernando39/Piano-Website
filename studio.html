		<h2>About My Studio</h2>


			<p>Welcome to Chiara Fernando's Piano Studio! I teach students that have a wide range in age, abilities, and experience. Having my piano studio at my home presents a safe and comforting environment for students to learn and explore. Students practice and play on a Yahama piano to ensure they are using professional level instruments to motivate and encourage their learning.</p>

			<p>I began my piano studio in 2016 and have taught students as young as five years old to adults. I aim to teach my students to become well-rounded musicians by teaching them the following: </p>
	 			<ul>
	 				<li>Music Theory</li>
	 				<li>Sight Reading</li>
	 				<li>Ear Training</li>
	 				<li>Technique</li>
	 				<li>Repertoire</li>
	 				<li>Musicianship</li>
	 				<li>Composition</li>
	 			</ul>

			<div class="full-text">
			<p>I use a variety of materials in my lessons depending on the needs and age of each student. I generally start off using the Piano Adventure books. These books are scaffolded to help students grasp concepts such as identifying notes, the staff, and teaches students how to practice in a healthy way. I also help students prepare to take RCM exams. RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music) examinations are very common for musicians to complete as it gives students a goal to work towards. Students can choose whether to use the Piano Adventures books or the RCM books depending on their interest. In addition, students can choose their own books or own song choices to work on.</p> </div>

		<h2>About My Studio</h2>


			<p>Welcome to Chiara Fernando's Piano Studio! I teach students that have a wide range in age, abilities, and experience. Having my piano studio at my home presents a safe and comforting environment for students to learn and explore. With students practicing and playing on a Yahama piano, it allows students to hear what professional instruments sound like which helps motivate and encourage their learning .</p>

			<p>I began my piano studio in 2016 and have taught students as young as five years old to adults. I aim to teach my students to become well-rounded musicians by teaching them the following: </p>
	 			<ul>
	 				<li>Music Theory</li>
	 				<li>Sight Reading</li>
	 				<li>Ear Training</li>
	 				<li>Technique</li>
	 				<li>Repertoire</li>
	 				<li>Musicianship</li>
	 				<li>Composition</li>
	 			</ul>

			<div class="full-text">
			<p>I use a variety of materials in my lessons depending on the needs and age of the student. I generally start off using the Piano Adventure books as these books are scaffolded to help students grasp concepts such as identifying notes on the staff, different types of notes, and teaches students how to practice in a healthy way. I also help students prepare for RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music) examinations. RCM examinations are very popular among musicians and gives students a goal to work towards so that they can see their progress. Students can choose which books they would like to use depending on their interest. In addition, students can choose their own books or own songs/pieces to work on.</p> </div>
